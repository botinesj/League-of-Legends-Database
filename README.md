During the 2021 Fall semester, for my Introduction to Databases course, my partner Khushkaran Deep Rajput and I were tasked with investigating a dataset in the public domain. We decided upon data compiled from the 2019 League of Legends World Championship and attempted to answer the following investigative questions:

1. What factors influence match length the most? 
2. Are there certain statistics that correlate with win rate the most? If so, are these more dependent on individual performance or team performance? 
3. How does the win rate vary as the number of matches a player uses the same champion increases?

In the pursuit of such a task, we:
- Designed and Implemented a relational schema using the SQL Data Definition Language
- Cleaned the dataset to prepare it for importing into a postgreSQL database
- Utilized the SQL Data Manipulation Language to explore the dataset  

The results of the investigation can be found in *discussion.pdf*
The relational schema we designed can be found in *schema.ddl*
